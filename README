# YouTube Gobbler

Fetches a list of all videos uploaded by a Youtube user.

## Usage

You will need to install a Java runtime environment from java.com. You may already have one.

Click on the "downloads" button and download youtubegobbler.jar.

Open a terminal in the directory of the file youtubegobbler.jar and use the following command.

     java -jar youtubegobbler.jar nongling21

You can, of course, replace nongling21 with another Youtube user to see a list of their videos. This program will only list videos that are publicly available.

## Compiling

If you wish to change the code and create a new version of the youtubegobbler.jar file, start by installing a Java Development Kit and Leiningen. Then run the following commands from a terminal in the same directory as project.clj.

     lein deps

     lein compile

     lein uberjar
